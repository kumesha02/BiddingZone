<p><strong>Cookware</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>bakeware</strong>&nbsp;is food preparation equipment, such as cooking pots, pans,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Baking sheet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_sheet">baking sheets</a>&nbsp;etc. used in&nbsp;<a title="Kitchen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen">kitchens</a>. Cookware is used on a&nbsp;<a title="Kitchen stove" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_stove">stove</a>&nbsp;or range&nbsp;<a title="Cooktop" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooktop">cooktop</a>, while bakeware is used in an&nbsp;<a title="Oven" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven">oven</a>. Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware.</p>
<p>There is a great variety of cookware and bakeware in shape, material, and inside surface. Some materials&nbsp;<a title="Thermal conductivity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity">conduct heat well</a>; some retain heat well. Some surfaces are&nbsp;<a title="Non-stick surface" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stick_surface">non-stick</a>; some require&nbsp;<a title="Seasoning (cookware)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasoning_(cookware)">seasoning</a>.</p>
<p>Some pots and their lids have handles or knobs made of low thermal conductance materials such as&nbsp;<a title="Bakelite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakelite">bakelite</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Plastic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic">plastic</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Wood" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood">wood</a>, which make them easy to pick up without&nbsp;<a title="Oven glove" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven_glove">oven gloves</a>.</p>
<p>A good cooking pot design has an "overcook edge" which is what the lid lies on. The lid has a dripping edge that prevents&nbsp;<a title="Condensation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation">condensation</a>&nbsp;fluid from dripping off when handling the lid (taking it off and holding it 45&deg;) or putting it down.</p>
